The [survey manager and survey implementer] in close collaboration with the [other relevant entities] are working to collect information about the availability of key health services in different facilities. This information will be collected in selected primary health care and secondary referral facilities across the country. The survey is part of the [government’s] ongoing efforts to understand what services are being offered and where they are being offered. The present study will be conducted across the country. Most facilities included in the survey were selected randomly from a list of all facilities in the country. As the in-charge of this facility, we are asking you to help us to collect the information from the persons who are most knowledgeable about the services. For any questions we ask, if there is another person who is in a better position to provide details, please feel free to refer us to that person. We will want to speak with persons familiar with the various services so that we can correctly identify the components of these services that are offered in this facility. We anticipate that the time required from an individual respondent to complete data collection from a service site may take from 5 to 10 minutes, depending on how busy each separate site is. Your participation in this survey is voluntary and at no cost to you as an individual. You may choose not to participate at all or to stop at any time before the end of the survey. You may also choose not to answer any question that you are not comfortable with. The information on service availability will be shared with the Ministry of Health (MOH) and other relevant stakeholders who support the MOH, to provide information for planning purposes. No names of any respondents will be shared. In case you have any question(s) about this survey at any time, please feel free to contact any of the following people:
